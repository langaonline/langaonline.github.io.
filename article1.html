             Kufike ixesha apha kwa Langa where losing a young life has become a norm. Iyi norm nje is because of the fact that 
			 death amongst youth is constantly occurring. To the residents of Langa it no longer causes a heart attack but becomes a minor shock nje.
			 Siyi community yakwa Langa si violent lomhlobo nah? To a point where sihlabana, sibulalana because of a useless fact 
			 that mna ndihlala ezone wena uhlala ekasi lowa uhlala eflatini. 
			 Ewe sometimes rivalry is a good thing 
			 but when it involves the death of others than ngenyi nto leyo. In this case the intervention of our police is desperately needed.
			 
            </p>

			In the past year we have lost over 15 young lives. Noko lonto should be alarming enough for the police to act. Instead, nothing ever happens. 
			Ask yourself, ngobha nam ndiyaz buza, if sinawo amapolisa nah okanye are they just lazy? Maybe andyaz ucinga ntoni wena. 
			Ewe we do not expect our police to unite our youth so that it may mirror the 1976 youth, 
			but setup a system which can fight youth gang violence kwa Langa.

                 According to PAC leader Sheila Mdunyelwa a system was setup by our concerned residents. 
				 Everyday ngo 7 a group of men would patrol our streets. This system however failed because it did not have the backing of our police. 
				 Inyani is that we not going to have a system anytime soon if amapolisa ethu failed to support ekhoyo.

		 Does this reflect ignorance okanye umnintsi umsebenzi for our police????
