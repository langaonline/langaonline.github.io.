				<p>
              There is no doubt that we have quality players in Langa playing in the Langa Football league (LFL).
			  But are they forever going to play in the LFL? Yes our league is exciting and fun to watch but our people need to see growth. 
			  We need to see more of our players playing on the next level which is NFD or PSL or playing for junior levels in clubs in these leagues. 
            </p>
            <p>The LFL leaderships should create opportunities for excellent players to go out and prove themselves. 
			Coaches should also not just keep their players just to win the LFL which is selfish but look for better clubs for their players.
			Because Good players tend to fade away as time passes by due to the lack of opportunities. 
			It seems like being a professional soccer player kwa Langa is just a dream that never comes true. 
			Players like Lwando Galada, Dj also known as Jiplo and Mazembe just to mention a few, where are these players now? 
			By now they should be playing at least in the NFD if not PSL. </p>

                
            


			 <p class="side">
               There is a new generation of exciting players coming up kwa Langa that might breakthrough. 
			   Players like Sam Mkiva, Ntaka Sohuma and many young players. Some of these players 
			   play for the first team in their teams and they look promising. 
			   For these players opportunities need to be created because they quality players. Players like these should not be allowed to fade away.
            </p>
			
			
            <p>
			The rest of the Langa community should support our soccer players. We should take the time to go watch them so that a good atmosphere is created. 
			Every Saturday afternoon matches are played, this could be your time to relax and just enjoy our very own soccer players.
