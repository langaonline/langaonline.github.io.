                Our local team PPG keeps on rising and stepping up to the plate whenever they participate in a major cup. 
				They were the first team to qualify for the bayhill kwa Langa in 2015 led by captain Lwazi “Dudu” Galada. 
				Being their first time on the tournament they never held back even against established teams such as Ajax. 
				They were knocked out in the last 16 of the tournament by Wits FC. 
				However the last 16 was a great achievement for them given that it was their first time.
            </p>
            <p>
			In 2016 they qualified for the same tournament being led by captain Kwanele “Kwa” Gongxeka. 
			The team showed their quality, character and experience against English team Swansea FC when they came from a goal down to level the match 1-1. 
			PPG topped the group and went on to the last 16 losing 1-0 to Ikapa FC in an exciting game.

               The Bayhill tournament has become a norm to them as they qualify every year for it. 
			   Early this year they qualified for the tournament for the third time running and this time led by captain Sakhe “Ntakha” Sohuma.
			   This year they went a step further to the last 8 of the tournament and lost to established PSL club Supersport FC. 
			   They then played for 5th position against Glendene FC which they one.
			   Recently they have come back from Sweden with a cup, winning the tournament they took part in. 
			   Surely 2017 and the years before have been outstanding for them. 
            </p>
            
			<p>Now the question is, are they going to win the local league and add to their trophy cabinet???
